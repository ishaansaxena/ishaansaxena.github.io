                    In his 1861 book Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill establishes his doctrine of utility, which he calls the Greatest Happiness Principle. This principle seems to be in conflict with our understanding of justice, insofar as actions made in adherence to the principle of utility often appear to be opposed to what a just action may seem like.

                    In several works, Immanuel Kant presents a doctrine which he calls transcendental idealism. Kant asserts that we create empirical intuitions of things through our sensory capacities and intuitions about space-time. Further, he argues that it is only possible to gain knowledge about objects through these empirical intuitions.

                    In his book, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke provides a non-substantial psychological account of personal identity. For Locke, the sameness of consciousness is both necessary and sufficient for the relation of personal identity to obtain. While this theory stands to be reasonable for most situations, there are several inconsistencies encountered when using memory as a phenomenon to determine personal identity.

                    The modern theories of dualism, centric to the study of the philosophy of mind, principally find their origin in Descartes’ Meditations. In his writings, Descartes asserts that there exists a separation between the mind and the body. He states that the mind and the body clearly have different essences or principal attributes, and thus cannot be identical to one another.

                    With the quick advent of Artificial Intelligence-based technology, we are experiencing a new era in the history of humanity. From voice assistants, to search engines, most pieces of technology that we use are forms of basic AI. The idea of machines which can think logically and abstractly, and act on their own as artificial moral agents, creates a lot of potential ethical problems.

The campaign, an animated music video titled Dumb Ways to Die, was released in November 2012, and soon became an internet sensation for its sheer brilliance.

                    Existentialism is a term that refers to a period of intellectual history concerned with the nature of the human condition. With the development of some of its key ideas in a particularly dreadful period of history, and its roots in the examination of man’s position in, his experience of and his relation with the universe, it seems to have a profound connection with the moral aspect of human existence.

                    Charlie Kaufman’s cinematic masterpiece ‘Synecdoche, New York’ is in many ways an investigation of life and Being through various motifs prevalent through the one hundred and twenty-four minutes of the movie. Kaufman tries to answer the question posed by Martin Heidegger ‘what does it mean to exist?’

                    Literature has been infused with stories about events unfolding through ‘fate’ and ‘destiny’ for a greater period of the history. These stories suggest that the development of certain incidents is a result of causal chains beyond the control of human choice. Such a viewpoint about the way events are caused is often termed as ‘Causal Deterministic’. These viewpoints have often worried Philosophers due to the kinds of consequences they might entail.

                    The study of meta-ethical theories has persistently attempted to answer a huge variety of questions about morality - the differentiation of intentions and actions between those that are right and those that are wrong. While questions about moral values do not usually have definitive answers, they provide deep insight into the nature and functions of morality. We examine some of these questions with the lens of Emotivism.
