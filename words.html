                        In his 1861 book Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill establishes his doctrine of utility, which he
                        calls the Greatest Happiness Principle. This principle seems to be in conflict with our
                        understanding of justice, insofar as actions made in adherence to the principle of utility often
                        appear to be opposed to what a just action may seem like.

                        In several works, Immanuel Kant presents a doctrine which he calls transcendental idealism. Kant

                        about space-time. Further, he argues that it is only possible to gain knowledge about objects
                        through these empirical intuitions.

                        In his book, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke provides a non-substantial
                        psychological account of personal identity. For Locke, the sameness of consciousness is both
                        necessary and sufficient for the relation of personal identity to obtain. While this theory stands
                        to be reasonable for most situations, there are several inconsistencies encountered when using
                        memory as a phenomenon to determine personal identity.

                        Literature has been infused with stories about events unfolding through ‘fate’ and ‘destiny’ for a
                        greater period of the history. These stories suggest that the development of certain incidents is a
                        result of causal chains beyond the control of human choice. Such a viewpoint about the way events
                        are caused is often termed as ‘Causal Deterministic’. These viewpoints have often worried
                        Philosophers due to the kinds of consequences they might entail.
